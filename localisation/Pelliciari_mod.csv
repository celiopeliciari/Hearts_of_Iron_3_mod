EVTDESC9920;Anglo Egyptian Treaty, treaty signed in London on August 26, 1936, that officially brought to an end 54 years of British occupation in Egypt.

EVTNAME9903;Franco Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9903; The Franco Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance was a bilateral treaty between France and the Soviet Union with the aim of enveloping Nazi Germany in 1935 to reduce the threat from Central Europe. The pact was concluded in Paris on 2 May 1935 and ratified by the French government in February 1936. Ratifications were exchanged in Moscow on 27 March 1936, and the pact went into effect the same day. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 18 April 1936.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA9903;France government ratified the pact;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA9904;Soviet government ratified the pact;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9905;By 1938, the appeasement policies implemented by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier ended collective security and further encouraged German aggression. The German Anschluss of Austria in 1938 and Munich Agreement, which led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939, demonstrated the impossibility of establishing a collective security system in Europe. That and the reluctance of the British and the French governments to sign a full scale antiGerman political and military alliance with the Soviets led to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in late August 1939.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA9905;We have no reason to believe in the Franco Soviet pact anymore;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME9906;End of Czechoslovak–Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance
EVTDESC9906;On 16 May 1935 the Czechoslovak–Soviet Treaty of Alliance was signed after the Soviet treaty with France. Despite that Germany had started a low intensity undeclared war on Czechoslovakia on 17 September 1938. In reaction, the United Kingdom and France on 20 September formally asked Czechoslovakia to cede its Sudetenland territory to Germany, which was followed by Polish territorial demands brought on 21 September and Hungarian on 22 September. An emergency meeting of the main European powers – not including Czechoslovakia – took place in Munich, Germany, on 29–30 September 1938. An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler's terms, being signed by the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. The Czechoslovak mountainous borderland that the powers offered to appease Germany had not only marked the natural border between the Czech state and the Germanic states since the early Middle Ages, but it also presented a major natural obstacle to any possible German attack. Having been strengthened by significant border fortifications, the Sudetenland was of absolute strategic importance to Czechoslovakia.On 30 September, Czechoslovakia yielded to the combination of military pressure by Germany, Poland and Hungary, and diplomatic pressure by the United Kingdom and France, and agreed to give up territory to Germany on Munich terms. Then, on 1 October, Czechoslovakia also accepted Polish territorial demands.;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME9908;Soviet Lithuanian Non Aggression Pact;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC9908;Remember with we had a pactsigned between the with Lithuania signed on September 28, 1926. The pact confirmed all basic provisions of the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920. The Soviet Union continued to recognize Vilnius and Vilnius Region to Lithuania, despite the fact that the territories were under Polish control since the Żeligowski's Mutiny in 1920. It also recognized Lithuania's interests in the Klaipėda Region. In exchange Lithuania agreed not to join any alliances directed against the Soviet Union, which meant international isolation at the time when Soviet Union was not a member of the League of Nations. Ratifications were exchanged in Kaunas on November 9, 1926, and the pact became effective on the same day. The pact was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on March 4, 1927. The pact was controversial in Lithuania and its ratification by the Third Seimas on 5 November 1926 caused student protests against "Bolshevization" of Lithuania. As one of the protests was dispersed by force, it is cited as one of the reasons for the military coup in December 1926. However, the diplomats believed that keeping the dispute over Vilnius Region relevant in the European politics was worth the cost. The original pact was set to expire in five years, but on 6 May 1931, it was extended for another five years. On April 4, 1934, it was further extended to December 31, 1944.;;;;;;;;x
